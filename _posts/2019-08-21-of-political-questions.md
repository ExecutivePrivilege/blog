# INTRODUCTION

With the recent midterm elections, Congressional Democrats have pledged to make use of their subpoena power. This Paper examines the applicability of the political question doctrine to disputes arising from Congressional subpoenas to Executive Branch officials. This Paper is split into three parts. Part-I provides a brief background sketch of the Executive Privilege. Since this Paper is primarily concerned with the prerequisite issue of whether the political question doctrine prevents a court from adjudicating Executive-Congressional subpoena disputes in the first place, and not with the applicability of the Executive Privilege in any particular instance, this Part does not purport to be an exhaustive examination of the precise meaning, scope, or purpose of the Executive Privilege. Part-II examines the applicability of the political question doctrine to disputes arising from an Executive Branch assertion of Executive Privilege in response to a Congressional subpoena. Part-III provides some brief concluding remarks.

## I. EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE & SETTING THE STAGE

The Executive Privilege is a documentary and testimonial government privilege to withhold certain Executive Branch information from disclosure. This Part briefly sketches the underlying rationale for the Executive Privilege and several historical flashpoints that contributed to its legal development.

### A. The Executive Privilege: An Overview**

"Since the beginnings of our nation, executive officials have claimed a variety of privileges to resist disclosure of information the confidentiality of which they felt was crucial to fulfillment of the unique role and responsibilities of the executive branch of our government."[^1] Among the types of information the Executive Privilege protects are state or military secrets,[^2] information and communications related to the deliberative process of Executive Branch decision-making,[^3] and Presidential communications.[^4] The common thread binding the information the Executive Privilege protects is the need for confidentiality. The rationale for shielding this information is intuitive. In order to effectively exercise the duties and powers of his office, the President and close advisors must be permitted to speak candidly. "Human experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process."[^5] The underlying benefits of candor and shielding the decision-making process are so great that the privilege even extends beyond communications to which the President is a party, and includes "communications made by presidential advisers in the course of preparing advice for the President . . . even when these communications are not made directly to the President."[^6] The Executive Privilege, then, protects not only sensitive communications and information, but also the integrity of the decision-making process itself.

Critics of the Executive Privilege contend that the Privilege can be used to shield government wrongdoing and potentially illegal conduct.[^7] But that concern is not unique to the Executive Privilege. "All of the constitutional provisions that impose restrictions on law enforcement and on the prosecution of crimes fall into the same category."[^8] The Fourth Amendment's "exclusionary rule generates 'substantial social costs,' *United States v. Leon*, 468 U. S. 897, 907 (1984), which sometimes include setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large."[^9] The Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination, inevitably stands in the way of eliciting confessions from criminal suspects in a custodial interrogation; the requirement that a suspect be read Miranda warnings "[i]n some unknown number of cases . . . will return a killer, a rapist or other criminal to the streets . . . to repeat his crime."[^10] Moreover, the Sixth Amendment's speedy trial guarantee carries with it "the unsatisfactorily severe remedy of dismissal of the indictment when the right has been deprived,"[^11] which "means that a defendant who may be guilty of a serious crime will go free, without having been tried."[^12] In all of these cases, "[t]he criminal goes free, if he must, but it is the law that sets him free."[^13]

In addition to Constitutional guarantees, recognized legal privileges protecting certain sensitive communications could also shield otherwise incriminating information from disclosure.[^14] The attorney-client privilege, "one of the oldest recognized privileges for confidential communications,"[^15] for example, "has the effect of withholding relevant information from the fact-finder."[^16] Legal privileges like the attorney-client privilege "serve[] much broader purposes"[^17] than the Constitutional guarantees abovementioned. These Constitutional guarantees protect the *individual*. A legal privilege, on the other hand, "is grounded in a policy of preventing disclosures that would tend to inhibit the development of confidential *relationships* that are socially desirable."[^18] In this respect, all legal privileges, including the Executive Privilege, share the same benefits that usually attach to a confidential communicative relationship: the effective performance of some vital societal function.

The consequences that even the slightest erosion of candor in Presidential decision-making would have are incalculable. Most of the analysis in this regard centers on the impact such erosion would have on the President's advisers' willingness to communicate candidly with the President if their remarks were subject to public disclosure. But the President, too, would also be affected. A President naturally inclined to receiving a multitude of views might insist on excluding from deliberations people whose ideas could be perceived as publicly unpopular. This exclusion would likely result from the common perception that "those trusted members of the President's inner circle 'who customarily meet with the President on a regular or frequent basis,' . . . are in many ways an extension of the President himself."[^19] Any unpopular or mildly controversial views brought up during the deliberative process would be imputed to the President himself. In such a situation, it would not be unreasonable for a President to perceive that diversity of thought might carry too much political risk. But "[w]hile the separation of powers may prevent us from righting every wrong, it does so in order to ensure that we do not lose liberty."[^20] The potentiality for abuse, therefore, is not enough to override the protections a privilege affords.

### B. The Modern Failure of Vindicating the President

While the Executive Privilege tends to receive public attention only when its invocation is tied to a criminal investigation, "Presidential claims of a right to preserve the confidentiality of information and documents [have] figured more prominently in executive-congressional relations."[^21] The history of Executive Branch refusals to supply requested or subpoenaed information to the Congress has been extensively documented.[^22] For most of our history, "the House and Senate relied on their own institutional power to not only enforce congressional subpoenas, but also to respond to other actions that either house viewed as obstructing their legislative processes or prerogatives."[^23] It was not until 183 years after the Founding, in 1973 and in the midst of Watergate, that the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities filed "the first civil action to enforce a congressional subpoena issued to the executive."[^24]

In the District Court,[^25] President Richard M. Nixon argued that the dispute constituted a political question not suitable for judicial resolution.[^26] The District Court rejected this argument, holding that the D.C. Circuit's reasoning in Nixon v. Sirica,[^27] which "involve[ed] a grand jury subpoena"[^28] to the President, was "equally applicable to the subpoena of a congressional committee."[^29] Furthermore, after applying the tests outlined in Baker v. Carr,[^30] the seminal political question doctrine case, the District Court concluded that there was "no doubt that the issues presented in the instant controversy are justiciable."[^31]

The District Court's analysis—the sum total of which amounted to a mere three sentences—is mistaken for two reasons.

First, *Nixon v. Sirica* did not address, and did not purport to address, the political question doctrine at all. In fact, the only place the phrase "political question" even appears is in the dissent.[^32] The "reasoning" of Nixon v. Sirica to which the District Court referred, then, is neither readily apparent nor accompanied by a pinpoint citation.[^33] Even if *Nixon v. Sirica* did address the political question doctrine issue, its reasoning would not be "equally applicable to the subpoena of a congressional committee."[^34] Such a notion is premised upon the assumption that Judicial subpoenas and Congressional subpoenas are constitutionally indistinct. This assumption, as detailed *infra*, is wrong. Second, a faithful application of Baker results in the conclusion that Congressional-Executive subpoena disputes are nonjusticiable. These are the issues to which I now turn.


## II. THE POLITICAL QUESTION DOCTRINE


The political question doctrine is a species of justiciability, and "is primarily a function of the separation of powers."[^35] As a result, the political question doctrine "prevents federal courts from overstepping their constitutionally defined role."[^36] In *Baker v. Carr*, the Supreme Court identified six indicia of the presence of a political question:

> [1] a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or [2] a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or [3] the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or [4] the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or [5] an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or [6] the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.[^37]

In the main, "[t]hese tests are probably listed in descending order of both importance and certainty."[^38] Conceptually, some courts have hinted the same thing and have pointed to Justice Powell's concurrence in *Goldwater v. Carter*, 444 U.S. 996 (1979) to note that "the first three *Baker* factors focus on the constitutional limitations of a court's jurisdiction, while the final three are 'prudential considerations [that] counsel against judicial intervention.'"[^39] The distinction between the two categories lies in the fact that a "'prudential doctrine' is generally reserved for self-imposed restraints that arise at the judiciary's discretion rather than by the command of the Constitution."[^40] But while the latter three factors could be considered prudentially self-imposed, the political question doctrine "is at bottom a jurisdictional limitation imposed on the courts by the Constitution, and not by the judiciary itself."[^41] Accordingly, the political question is firmly rooted in the Constitution and is a core tenant of our notion of separation of powers.

In the context of a Congressional subpoena fight for Executive Branch information, the first two factors—textual commitment and judicially discoverable and manageable standards—are the most relevant. While textual commitment and judicial standards constitute two independent factors, they are "not completely separate . . . ; the lack of judicially manageable standards may strengthen the conclusion that there is a textually demonstrable commitment to a coordinate branch."[^42] That the six factors may not be entirely independent of each other demonstrates "the necessity for discriminating inquiry into the precise facts and posture of the particular case, and the impossibility of resolution by any semantic cataloguing."[^43] Any examination of this issue must, therefore, be mindful of even minor distinctions between even the most granular of details. The issues of textual commitment and judicial standards are examined in turn.

### A. Textual Commitment

The textual commitment to which *Baker* refers is the degree to which the text of the Constitution commits a particular action to one of the three Branches. Thus, under this factor, a court "must, in the first instance, interpret the text in question and determine whether and to what extent the issue is textually committed."[^44] I first begin with an analysis of the text itself and then examine whether our Nation's history and tradition comport with the text.[^45]

#### 1. Textual Analysis

The Constitution explicitly refers to Executive Branch information, and under what circumstances it shall be provided to Congress. Article II, section 3,[^46] states of the President, in part, that "He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . . . ." The comma after the word "Union" separates this provision into two clauses, the first of which is referred to as the "State of the Union Clause," and the second of which is referred to as the "Recommendation Clause."[^47] This Paper focuses on the former for purposes of the textual commitment analysis.

The State of the Union Clause confers upon the President a qualified duty to engage the Congress in the lawmaking process. A close textual and historical examination of the State of the Union Clause reveals that the President enjoys nearly unlimited discretion to withhold from the Congress information the disclosure of which he deems would be contrary to the public interest.

The first hint that the State of the Union Clause textually commits to the President some form of duty is the first two words: "He shall."[^48] Article II is unique, in that it imputes Constitutional powers and duties into a single person, the President.[^49] As one pair of scholars note, "no analogous clauses appear in Articles I or III."[^50] The State of the Union Clause also does not "signify any kind of congressional prerogative";[^51] there is a reason the Clause does not say, "'Congress may from time to time require the President to give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.'"[^52] Indeed, whatever the State of the Union Clause means, one thing is for sure: it is "obviously about the President."[^53]

The consensus among modern commentators is that the State of the Union Clause confers an Executive duty.[^54] This conclusion is structurally and textually intuitive. In describing the powers and duties of the President, Article II explicitly says what "he shall have Power" to do.[^55] Executive duties, on the other hand, only contain the phrase "he shall" do.[^56] What one shall have and what one shall do are two separate things. Only in the latter case does one contextually derive a meaning of what the President "[h]as a duty to; [or] more broadly, is required to"[^57] do. Indeed, it would be somewhat vacuous to say that the President has a duty to have certain powers.

At least one commentator places a very strong emphasis on a rejected draft version of the State of the Union Clause that explicitly used the word "duty" to bolster their argument that the Clause confers a duty.[^58] This draft specifically said it was the President's "‘duty to inform the Legislature of the Condition of the U.S. so far as may respect his Department.'"[^59] While reference to rejected drafts to determine the ratified meaning may be tempting, "[i]t is always perilous to derive the meaning of an adopted provision from another provision deleted in the drafting process."[^60] Not only is it perilous, but it can also be very self-serving. Specifically in the context of the State of the Union Clause, preference for this particular draft of the Clause is understandable, because it is the only draft that contains the word "duty." The other drafts of the State of the Union Clause[^61] track more closely to the adopted version. One draft, authored by James Rutledge,[^62] appeared in a list of items under a heading referring to what the President's "powers shall be,"[^63] and said the President "shall propose to the Legisle. from Time to Time by Speech or Messg such Meas as concern this Union."[^64] Another draft by James Wilson would have read, "[h]e shall from Time to Time give information of the State of the Nation to the Legislature."[^65] The "Nation to the Legislature" language was crossed out and replaced by John Rutledge with the following draft: "He shall from Time to Time give information to the Legislature of the State of the Union."[^66] The final change, as reflected in the ratified version, was to replace "Legislature" with "Congress."[^67]

This more complete drafting history demonstrates several issues inherent in selective references to drafting history. The most obvious issue into which one inevitably runs with such selective references is explaining in a principled way why any one particular rejected draft should be given more interpretive weight than the other rejected drafts. Why should not the State of the Union Clause be regarded as a power, given that one of the drafts apparently classified it as such? The number of drafts referring to the State of the Union Clause as a power is equal to the number of drafts referring to it as a duty: one. Is it a draw?

References to drafting history oftentimes function as a smokescreen for grafting one's *preferred* meaning onto a provision, rather than giving the provision its adopted meaning. Chief Justice Marshall famously wrote that "[i]t cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect."[^68] Giving weight to a textually distinct rejected draft provision contradicts Marshall's statement, because doing so operates on the presumption that clauses *not even in the Constitution* can be given not only effect, but also *preference* over the adopted provision.

One scholar in particular, the late Raoul Berger,[^69] chalked the differences between the rejected draft and adopted versions up to "represent[ing] a broadened and stylistically improved articulation of that duty."[^70] But this puts the horse before the cart. One cannot assume that any alteration in the drafting process was merely the result of stylistic preference without first interpreting the final adopted provision. Surely one would never interpret a provision with a clear and commanding use of "shall" to really just be a more stylistically improved version of a draft that used a permissive "may." Indeed, the fact that a particular word or phrase was inserted or omitted in the final version may, to the contrary, equally be evidence of what a provision does not mean. To be sure, not all textual changes result in substantive changes in meaning. Use of "shall" and omission of the word "duty" in the ratified State of the Union Clause is one example of an alteration that does not change its resulting substantive meaning. In this respect, my qualm is not with the conclusion, but with the method of finding a duty in the State of the Union Clause.

However, not all changes between the draft and ratified versions of the State of the Union Clause are without effect. The most striking change between the draft and ratified versions was the inclusion of the phrase "from time to time." This phrase is a dark horse in modern analyses of the State of the Union Clause, and is from where the President derives his discretion in determining whether and what types of information he shall give to the Congress. Perhaps due to the fact that the Clause "has too mechanically been associated with annual presidential messages"[^71] (*i.e.*, what is now referred to as the State of the Union address), the discretionary aspect of the "from time to time" language has heretofore been overlooked completely or only implicitly hinted at in contemporary scholarship.[^72]

The phrase "from time to time," in addition to the State of the Union Clause, appears in three Constitutional provisions. Two of these provisions appear in Article I: (1) the Journal Clause[^73] and (2) the Receipts and Expenditures Clause.[^74] Both of these provisions, like the State of the Union Clause, couple "from time to time" with the modal verb "shall." The third provision is found in Article III's Vesting Clause,[^75] and uses the modal verb "may."

"From time to time" was originally understood at the time of the founding and after as a phrase imputing discretion. Two of the most influential members of the Constitutional Convention, James Madison and George Mason, understood the phrase to impute discretion, as their debate on the Receipts and Expenditures Clause demonstrates. An early draft of the Receipts and Expenditures Clause, proposed by George Mason, read, "that an Account of the public expenditures should be annually published."[^76] James Madison offered an amendment "to strike out ‘annually' . . . & insert ‘from time to time'."[^77] The rationale for this proposed amendment, Madison explained, was that it "would enjoin the duty of frequent publications and *leave enough to the discretion of the Legislature*."[^78] Madison further said during the Virginia Ratifying Convention that this meant the receipts and expenditures would be "occasionally published"[^79] and "authorises the government to withhold from the public knowledge what in their judgment may require secrecy."[^80]

Mason shared Madison's interpretation of the "from time to time" language, but did not support the amendment, because it was a "loose expression"[^81] that "was applicable to any time. It was equally applicable to monthly or septennial periods."[^82] Mason then characterized "[t]he reasons urged in favor of this ambiguous expression"[^83] as suggesting "that there might be some matters which might require secrecy. In matters relative to military operations, and foreign negotiations, secrecy was necessary sometimes,"[^84] but Mason did not think the receipts and expenditures for such activities "ought ever to be concealed."[^85]

In *Halperin v. Central Intelligence Agency*, 629 F.2d 144 (D.C. Cir 1980), the court examined the applicability of several statutes exempting the CIA from disclosing certain national security information to the CIA's refusal to disclose "documents detailing legal bills and legal fee agreements with private attorneys retained by the Agency."[^86] Part of the court's analysis centered specifically on the "from time to time" language in the Receipts and Expenditures Clause. The court extrapolated three conclusions from the debate between Madison and Mason regarding Framers intent of the Receipts and Expenditures Clause: (1) "Madison's comment on governmental discretion to maintain secrecy of some expenditures . . . , was representative of his fellow proponents of the ‘from time to time' provision"; (2) "as to what items might legitimately require secrecy, the debates contain prominent mention of military operations and foreign negotiation"; and (3) "opponents of the ‘from time to time' provision . . . , favored secrecy only for the operations and negotiations themselves, not for receipts and expenditures of public money connected with them."[^87] In addition to the Convention and Virginia Ratifying debates, the court also examined "the historical evidence of government practices with regard to disclosure and secrecy both before and after the enactment of the Constitution,"[^88] and concluded, among other things, that the Framers "intended Congress and the President to have discretion to maintain the secrecy of intelligence expenditures."[^89] Accordingly, the court held the documents to be within the scope of the statute's exemption.[^90]

This inherent discretionary connotation is specific to the phrase "from time to time" and not to the particular provision in which the phrase appears. During an 1802 debate in the Senate on a bill that would have repealed the Judiciary Act of 1801, Stevens Thompson Mason,[^91] who was a delegate to Virginia's 1788 Ratifying Convention, compared the State of the Union Clause to Article III's Vesting Clause. Article III's Vesting Clause states, in part, that "[t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish."[^92] Mason observed:

> When, therefore, the Constitution, using this language, says a Supreme Court shall be established, are we not justified in considering it as of Constitutional creation? And on the other hand, from the language applied to inferior courts, are we not equally justified in considering their establishment as dependent upon the Legislature, who may, from time to time, ordain them, *as the public good requires*? Can any other meaning be applied to the words "from time to time?" . . .
>
> We find the phrase, "from time to time," in another part of the Constitution. The 3d section of the 2d article says, the President shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information of the state of the Union. That is, he shall *occasionally, as he sees fit*, give such information. So shall Congress occasionally, as they see fit, establish annual [sic] or regulate inferior courts, accordingly *as the public welfare requires*.[^93]

Importantly, Mason understood Congress's discretion to establish inferior courts to arise not from the use of the word "may," but rather from the phrase "from time to time." This further confirms that the meaning of "from time to time" is not dependent upon its surrounding context, but rather retains its meaning notwithstanding. Another important observation that Mason makes is with whom the discretion lays: the President. In both Clauses, Mason argues that the person or entity tasked with taking a particular action retains the discretion. Accordingly, Mason interprets the State of the Union Clause to give the President unilateral discretion (*i.e.*, "as he sees fit") in deciding whether, when, and what information to give to the Congress.

Mason's comparison of Article III's Vesting Clause and the State of the Union Clause also raises the question of what the different respective textual impacts the modal verbs "shall" and "may" have on the phrase "from time to time." Indeed, if each clause in the Constitution is to be given effect, then it cannot be assumed that "shall from time to time" means the same thing as "may from time to time." The modal verb in this situation functions as a tiebreaker. So, for example, if the President determines that giving the Congress certain information will serve the public interest, then the Constitution, pursuant to the use of the duty-imposing "shall," requires him to give such information. On the flip side, if, pursuant to Article III's Vesting Clause, Congress decides that establishing additional inferior courts would serve the public interest, the Constitution, due to the use of the permissive "may," authorizes the Congress to do so, but does not require it, and contemplates the taking of no action as an acceptable outcome under such circumstances.

#### 2. History and Tradition Confirm the President's Unlimited Discretion

Our Nation's history and tradition further confirm the findings of the textual analysis above. This section examines the statements of authoritative Constitutional commentators, as well as the empirical relationship between the Executive and Legislative Branches.

##### i. Authoritative Legal Commentators Did Not Doubt the Executive's Discretion

The President's discretion in giving information to the Congress was never seriously questioned by any of the oft-cited 19th century legal commentators. To the extent it was discussed at all,[^94] the State of the Union Clause was seen as conferring an Executive duty, and arising from the fact that the Executive tends to have access to a wider swath of information, particularly regarding the execution of the laws.[^95] Moreover, these commentators did not perceive the State of the Union Clause as a dragnet, and instead identified particular information to which the duty extended.

St. George Tucker described the duty as extending only to information that "may be necessary to assist [the Congress's] deliberations on the several subjects *confided to them by the constitution*."[^96] Joseph Story similarly suggested that the "information" referred to in the State of the Union Clause needed to serve a legislative purpose, such as "the defects in the nature of arrangements of the general systems of trade, finance, and justice; and the military, naval, and civil establishments of the Union."[^97] The President's duty, Story said, conferred a responsibility, not only for "a due administration of the existing systems, but for due diligence and examination into the means of improving them."[^98]

William Rawle identified the President as "the regular channel through which the legislature becomes informed of the political situation of the United Sates in its foreign, as well as its domestic relations."[^99] Rawle explicitly acknowledged the Executive's sole and unilateral discretion in giving information to the Congress, noting that "it has been always understood that he is not required to communicate more, than in his apprehension, may be consistent with the public interests."[^100] Rawle also identified the virtue of confidentiality in facilitating candid advice and protecting sensitive information:

> If all the transactions of a cabinet, whether in respect to internal or external business, were regularly exhibited to the public eye, its own operations would be impeded ; the public mind be perplexed, and improper advantages would sometimes be taken. Foreign powers, pursuing as they invariably do, a different course themselves, would justly object to such proceeding.[^101]

William Howard Taft, the only person to ever serve as both the President and Chief Justice of the United States, quite explicitly said the President possesses the sole and unilateral discretion to determine the information he transmits to Congress:

> The President is required by the Constitution from time to time to give to Congress information on the state of the Union, and to recommend for its consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient, *but this does not enable Congress or either House of Congress to elicit from him confidential information* which he has acquired for the purpose of enabling him to discharge his constitutional duties, if *he* does not deem the disclosure of such information prudent or in the public interest.[^102]

The positions of these commentators can be distilled into two principles. First, as Tucker and Story suggest, the only information to which the Congress may legitimately have a claim is information that serves a legislative purpose, such as how laws could be improved. Second, Rawle and Taft make the case that it is within the President's exclusive prerogative to determine whether certain confidential information can, consistent with the public interest, be properly transmitted to the Congress. I next examine whether these principles were merely words on the respective pages of legal treatises, or whether they embody values by which the Executive- Congressional relationship has been historically governed.

##### ii. Empirical Executive-Congressional Relationship

As previously noted, it was not until relatively recently that Congress used litigation as a strategy for enforcing a subpoena against a coordinate Branch of government. And even since then, the Congress or one of its committees has filed such a case only a handful of times.[^103] One reason for the lack of early litigation could be reflective of the Congress's belief that it did not have the power to compel the Executive Branch to produce information the disclosure of which the President believed would be contrary to the public interest. As former Vermont Federalist Representative James Elliot said in 1809, "[e]very gentleman knows that we have not the power to coerce information; our power is limited to the request."[^104] Another Member of Congress likened the Congress's power to request to the First Amendment's right of petition.[^105]

The first time the Congress attempted to exercise oversight of the Executive Branch is particularly instructive. On March 27, 1792, the House of Representatives passed a resolution to appoint a committee "to inquire into the causes of the failure of the late expedition under Major General St. Clair; and that the said committee be empowered to call for such persons, papers, and records, as may be necessary to assist their inquiries."[^106] Four days later, President George Washington convened a cabinet meeting to discuss the resolution.[^107] As Thomas Jefferson, then-Secretary of State, wrote of the meeting that, while Washington had not at that time given the propriety of the House's actions much thought, Washington nevertheless "could readily conceive there might be papers of so secret a nature, as that they ought not to be given up."[^108] Two days later, on April 2, 1792, another cabinet meeting was held to again discuss how to respond to the House inquiry.[^109] At this meeting, Jefferson reported that everyone "had all considered, and were of one mind"[^110] on four principles: (1) "that the House was an inquest, and therefore might institute inquiries";[^111] (2) that the House "might call for papers generally";[^112] (3) "that the Executive ought to communicate such papers as the public good would permit, and ought to refuse those, the disclosure of which would injure the public: consequently were to exercise a discretion";[^113] and (4) "that neither the committee nor House had a right to call on the Head of a Department, who and whose papers were under the President alone; but that the committee should instruct their chair man to move the House to address the President."[^114]

The Cabinet ultimately "agreed . . . that there was not a paper which might not be properly produced,"[^115] but "the President apparently felt it advisable nevertheless to negotiate with Congress a non-confrontational resolution of the problem."[^116] Jefferson assisted in these negotiations and courted members Congress to try and "bring them by persuasion into the right channel."[^117] Jefferson has been credited with persuading the Congress to adopt a resolution more tethered to the views of the Cabinet.[^118] This newer resolution only called for "such papers of a public nature,"[^119] as opposed to papers generally.[^120]

While the Congress typically engages in a chest-beating exercise when the Executive Branch has flouted one of its requests for information, the Congress has seldom taken drastic measures against the Executive Branch. In one early example, the House demanded the President produce a report that documented certain fraudulent transactions.[^121] The President delayed production of the report for over six months.[^122] The Committee noted in its final report that "[a]ll the means to enforce the attendance of witnesses, . . . as well as to procure all necessary . . . evidence, relative to any subject of inquiry in which it might be engaged, is possessed by the House in as much plenitude as by the judicial tribunals of the country."[^123] The Committee even went so far as to claim that the President's delay was "subversive of the constitutional rights of the House of Representatives."[^124] After this chest beating, the Committee did not pursue any further inquiry of the matter, meagerly blaming the "advanced stage of the session"[^125] of Congress. It is worth pointing out, though, that the Congress could have still pursued other methods of Presidential accountability, such as impeachment, because President John Tyler still had over two years left in his term at the time of the report.

In another instance, the House Judiciary Committee specifically examined the propriety of a State Department official refusing to turn over certain books containing both his professional and private affairs.[^126] The Committee's final report noted that when the President lodges a claim that it would "not [be] consistent with the public interest to give the House such [requested] information, no further proceedings have ever been taken to compel the production of such information."[^127] This sentiment tracks with contemporary understandings that an overly aggressive posture toward the Executive Branch would pose certain Constitutional problems.[^128] The Committee then said of its own power that it "cannot call for the records of [the President's] actions or the action of his officers against his consent, any more than [the President] can call for any of the journals and records of the House or Senate."[^129] The Committee went further and recognized "[t]he mischief of the House calling for documents might easily be a very great one."[^130] The amount of self-restraint exhibited in this particular report is remarkable, and not something that one would think the Congress would say about itself today.[^131]

The Congress has actually continued to recognize the President's legitimate duty to not produce information to the Congress that he deems to be contrary to the public interest. The latest version of the Constitution Annotated, a Senate Document produced by the Congressional Research Service every ten years, concedes that the President possesses the discretion to withhold such information from the Congress:

> Today, there is no subject on which the President may not appropriately communicate to Congress, in as precise terms as he chooses, his conception of its duty. Conversely, the President *is not obliged by this clause to impart information which, in his judgment, should in the public interest be withheld*.[^132]

In sum, both the Congress and the President have been relatively consistent in understanding that the President's duty to give information to the Congress of the State of the Union comes with it an inherent discretion to determine whether the communication of any particular piece of information would be consistent with the public interest.

### B. Judicially Discoverable and Manageable Standards

Whether there are judicially discoverable and manageable standards in controversies arising from the assertion of Executive privilege in response to a Congressional subpoena has received the most attention from the courts. This particular body of law is by no means extensive, because the number of cases arising from a Congressional subpoena for Executive Branch information is very small. Because cases of this type are seldom decided, arise in the most publicly spectacular fashion, and affect the balance of power between the political branches, the need to not only decide the cases, but to decide them correctly is arguably much more pressing than in other similarly high profile cases.

The types of judicially discoverable and manageable "standards" for which courts look in political question doctrine cases are legal standards courts typically apply. In *Harris v. Kellogg, Brown & Root Services, Inc.*, 618 F.Supp.2d 400 (W.D. Pa. 2009), the court examined whether the political question doctrine applied to a wrongful death and survival claims suit against a private military contractor, stemming from the death of a member of the armed forces "after a water pump short circuited, causing him to be electrocuted while showering at a military base in Baghdad, Iraq."[^133] The claims centered on an allegation that the defendant's "negligence proximately caused" the death.[^134] The mere fact that the allegedly negligent act occurred during wartime in a hostile zone where the military was operating did not mean the question was inherently political. As the court noted, "[t]he type of judgments that are insulated from judicial review involve *inherently military activities* including combat operations and training exercises."[^135] Therefore, since the particular action was "an ordinary tort suit seeking money damages against a private corporation,"[^136] the court held that it could "apply traditional negligence principles to determine the parties' respective rights and liabilities."[^137]

However, simply because an action, on the surface, appears to be resolvable by familiar judicial standards does not mean that its resolution does not touch upon political questions. In *Corrie v. Caterpillar, Inc.*, 503 F.3d 974 (9th Cir. 2007), the court examined the propriety of Caterpillar selling bulldozers to the Israeli Defense Forces. The Israeli Defense Forces has used the bulldozers "to demolish homes in the Palestinian Territories."[^138] During one such demolition, several Palestinians were killed or injured.[^139] The resulting suit, brought by family members of the killed and injured against Caterpillar, alleged various civil and tort claims,[^140] and sought "compensatory and punitive damages; declaratory relief; and an injunction directing Caterpillar to cease providing equipment to the IDF so long as its illegal practices continue; and costs and attorneys' fees."[^141] Caterpillar disclosed that, while the Israeli Defense Forces ordered directly from Caterpillar, the United States government *paid* for them.[^142] That the United States paid for the bulldozers was held to be "[t]he decisive factor"[^143] in the case. Finding that "[w]hether to grant military or other aid to a foreign nation is a political decision inherently entangled with the conduct of foreign relations,"[^144] the court explained, "[i]t is difficult to see how we could impose liability on Caterpillar without at least implicitly deciding the propriety of the United States' decision to pay for the bulldozers which allegedly killed the plaintiffs' family members."[^145]

When it comes to deciding a case arising from an assertion of Executive Privilege in response to a Congressional subpoena, courts have drawn on Executive Privilege cases arising out of criminal prosecutions for guidance.[^146] This has led courts to treat Congressional subpoenas as Constitutionally indistinct from court issued subpoenas.[^147] As first noted in Part-I(A), the basis for this contention is shaky. However, a further look at the case law and relevant authorities reveals that Congressional and Judicial subpoenas are constitutionally distinct, and that the principles that govern the latter do not govern the former.

At the outset, the Supreme Court in Nixon, the principles of which have since governed every Executive Privilege case, went to great lengths to say that it was "address[ing] only the conflict between the President's assertion of a generalized privilege of confidentiality and the constitutional need for relevant evidence in criminal trials."[^148] Additionally, the court explicitly couched its analysis of the effect on candor that exposure of Presidential aides' deliberations will have "in the context of a criminal prosecution."[^149] The Court also made clear that its decision is related to an activity that is exclusively within its realm of Constitutional power—namely, determining which evidence is relevant and admissible for use in a criminal prosecution, pursuant to Article III.

From this, several observations can be made. First, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to Congressional investigations. This means that the court is not, in fact, engaged in the sort of garden-variety subpoena enforcement case, and is not operating pursuant to the judicial standards typically at issue.[^150] Second, many of the examples that modern courts rely upon to demonstrate that enforcing a Congressional subpoena is merely an extension of what courts traditionally do are still related to the court's duties under Article III. "[D]eposition or trial subpoenas"[^151] issued pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are still inherently and institutionally tied to the courts, because the subpoenas are issued *pursuant to*, not *prior to*, the commencement of a legal claim. "[C]ases involving the propriety of search warrants issued by the executive branch against Members of Congress that implicate issues concerning Speech or Debate Clause immunity"[^152] likewise fail to justify the extension of judicial review to Congressional subpoenas issued to Executive Branch officials, because, like grand jury and trial subpoenas, *the court itself* issues search warrants. Article III commands courts to ensure that the dictates of the Constitution's procedural guarantees are complied with.

The purpose of Congressional and Judicial subpoenas is also distinct. "There is a clear difference between Congress's legislative tasks and the responsibility of a grand jury, or any institution engaged in like functions."[^153] The D.C. Circuit eloquently explained,

> While fact-finding by a legislative committee is undeniably a part of its task, legislative judgments normally depend more on the predicted consequences of proposed legislative actions and their political acceptability, than on precise reconstruction of past events; Congress frequently legislates on the basis of conflicting information provided in its hearings. In contrast, the responsibility of the grand jury turns entirely on its ability to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that certain named individuals did or did not commit specific crimes. If, for example, as in Nixon v. Sirica, one of those crimes is perjury concerning the content of certain conversations, the grand jury's need for the most precise evidence, the exact text of oral statements recorded in their original form, is undeniable.[^154]

Thus, separation of powers concerns would be at play in a Congressional-Executive Branch subpoena fight for two reasons. First, the court would be impinging upon the Legislative Branch, because the court would essentially be deciding the appropriate evidentiary and testimonial scope of a Congressional inquiry. Second, the court would be unnecessarily interfering with the Executive Branch's dealings with the Legislative Branch and be making judgment calls about privilege in a proceeding in which a court does not have expertise—namely, a Congressional inquiry. So while judicially issued process and warrants are at the apex of a court's Article III authority, to permit the Judiciary to referee a subpoena battle between the political branches would functionally bestow upon the Judiciary quasi-legislative *and* quasi-executive powers in violation of each Branch's prerogatives.

An unlikely ally in this argument over judicial standards is Archibald Cox, the first Watergate Special Prosecutor, who was fired in the so-called "Saturday Night Massacre." Cox was of the opinion that accommodation, rather than litigation, was the appropriate remedy for these disputes, and that he would "be content to see that the Judicial Branch deny its constitutional power and leave questions of executive privilege vis-à-vis Congress to the ebb and flow of political power."[^155]

Cox points to two examples during the Eisenhower administration to demonstrate the difficulty in applying traditional standards to these disputes. The first was President Eisenhower's refusing to hand over documents to Senator Joseph McCarthy's committee that was looking into the Army's loyalty and security program.[^156] The second was a refusal to hand over documents related to the Dixon-Yates contract. In a bit of complete candor, Cox said, "[h]istory will record that President Eisenhower's first refusal was morally and politically justified and that the second was wrong, but I can formulate no rule of law not turning upon judgments of motive and political desirability for distinguishing between them."[^157] And indeed, there appears to be no readily available standards that can legally distinguish these two incidents.

Cox finally observed that there is "little evidence that the nation has suffered from the want of legal power to compel the President to satisfy the demands of Congress to information in the Executive Branch."[^158] Faced with this, the notion that the Judiciary has any business in adjudicating these disputes is wholly untenable.

## III. CONCLUSION

In sum, the State of the Union Clause confers a qualified Executive duty upon the President. Pursuant to that duty, the President has a corresponding discretion to withhold information from the Congress the disclosure of which he determines would be contrary to the public interest. The State of the Union Clause's history, text, and tradition confirm that the President is to solely exercise this discretion, with no place for Congress. Accordingly, the Executive Branch would likely benefit from deploying the State of the Union Clause if and when it is engaged in litigation with the Congress.

[^25]: A brief word on the procedural history and the corresponding notation of the resulting cases: On July 23, 1973, the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities issued a subpoena duces tecum to President Richard M. Nixon demanding the production of certain audiotape recordings of conversations between President Nixon and his top aides. Subpoena Duces Tecum (for Tape Recordings) Served on President Richard M. Nixon (Jul. 23, 1973), *reprinted in* Appendix to the Hearings (Part I): *Hearings before the S. Comm. on Presidential Campaign Activities*, 93 Cong. 216 (1974) [hereinafter Appendix]. On October 17, 1973, the District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities (Senate Select Comm. I), 366 F.Supp. 51 (D.D.C. 1973). The Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities appealed. Notice of Appeal at 1, Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon (Senate Select Comm. I), 366 F.Supp. 51 (D.D.C. 1973) (No. 1593-73), *reprinted in* Appendix, 93 Cong. 998 (1974). The Senate then passed on November 2, 1973, Senate Resolution 194 stating that the Select Committee had the authority to sue the President and that, in doing so, it was acting pursuant to a legitimate legislative purpose. 119 Cong. Rec. (Bound) 35714 (Nov. 2, 1973). That same day, Chairman Ervin introduced legislation conferring upon the District Courts jurisdiction to enforce the Select Committee's subpoena. *Id*. at 35714-35715. The bill became law on December 19, 1973. Pub. L. No. 93–190 (Dec. 18, 1973). On December 28, 1973, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit then remanded the case to the District Court to evaluate the case in light of the legislation. Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon (Senate Select Comm. III), 498 F.2d 725, 728 n. 11 (citing Order, No. 73-2086 (D.C. Cir., Dec. 28, 1973) (en banc)); *see also* Appendix, 93 Cong. 1046 (1974) (reprint of Order, No. 73-2086 (D.C. Cir., Dec. 28, 1973) (en banc)). On remand, the District Court denied the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities' request to enforce the subpoena. Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon (Senate Select Comm. II), 370 F.Supp. 521 (D.D.C. 1974). On appeal, the D.C. Circuit affirmed the District Court's order. Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon (Senate Select Comm. III), 498 F.2d 725 (D.C. Cir. 1974). Accordingly, Senate Select Comm. I refers to the initial District Court's order; Senate Select Comm. II refers to the District Court's decision on remand; and Senate Select Comm. III refers to the decision of the D.C. Circuit.

[^33]: To be sure, Baker v.

But this statement is merely an expression of judicial perseverance, not a reason whether or not the political question doctrine applies in a particular context. The most favorable gloss that can be gleaned from Sirica is that the court must have understood the controversy to be justiciable, because the court ended up proceeding to and deciding the case on the merits.

[^46]: In many situations, Presidents will rely upon other duties found in Article II, section 3 to justify withholding information from Congress. *See, e.g.*, *Assertion of Executive Privilege Over Documents Generated in Response to Congressional Investigation Into Operation Fast and Furious*, 36 Op.

[^47]: There is not a clear consensus in the little academic literature existing on this topic about whether the State of the Union Clause is distinct so as to warrant its detachment from the Recommendation Clause for purposes of individual interpretation. Indeed, one author has implicitly suggested both that the State of the Union Clause is part of the Recommendation Clause and its own standalone clause. *Compare* J.

[^131]: This is likely due in large part to the shifting nature of Congressional investigations, which since the Truman administration have become more focused on political embarrassment than with a conciliatory body politic. *See, e.g.*, M. Nelson McGeary, *Congressional Investigations: Historical Development*, 18 U. CHI. L. REV. 425, 431 (1951) ("From the very first inquiry in 1792, one purpose of many investigations had been to embarrass the Administration"); *ibid.* ("Congressmen, when they investigated the executive branch, not infrequently were politically motivated; they sought electioneering ammunition with as much earnestness as they delved for information to aid in legislating."); *id.* at 437 (explaining that, "[u]nder President Truman the emphasis of some investigations shifted partially to an attempt to embarrass or discredit the Administration."). This same commentator also noted, "[i]t has become increasingly evident . . . that the major responsibility for preventing misuse of the power of investigation rests on Congress itself." *Id.* at 439.
